Like the other Metallic Arts, Allomancy as a magic system formed through the natural interactions between the two Shards that inhabit Scadrial, Preservation and Ruin, and the planet itself, instead of being created by a specific Shard. This magic system, however, is generally tailored and fuelled by Preservation, although specific cases will involve an Allomancer drawing upon Ruin's essence instead. Like other forms of Investiture, Allomancy does not necessarily reflect the intent of the Shard which it is associated with.\n",

      "Allomancy, Allomancy\n",
      "Allomancy is the most widely used form of Investiture on Scadrial, and is locally known as one of the three Metallic Arts. People who have one or more Allomantic abilities are called Allomancers with each Allomantic power being paired with a type of metal, which must be ingested and \"burned\" to activate.\n",

      "Allomancy, Allomantic Metals\n",
      "There are sixteen basic Allomantic metals. The metals come in pairs: one metal is a periodic element, while the other is the alloy of that base metal. These pairs have complementary effects. Iron Pulls on nearby metals, while its alloy, steel, Pushes on metals. Similarly, each elemental metal is classified as a \"Pulling\" ability, whereas each alloy is classified as a \"Pushing\" ability. The purity of the metal corresponds to its effectiveness and alloys require precise compound percentages for maximum power. Burning an impure alloy may cause sickness, while metals that are not Allomantically viable cannot be burned after being ingested.\n",

      "Allomancy, Mechanics\n",
      "Allomantic metals are the focus, but not the source, of Allomancy's power. When an Allomancer burns a metal, that metal's specific molecular structure acts as a conduit to Preservation, and then the Allomancer is granted an ability corresponding to the metal, allowing the metal to \"focus\" Preservation's power to the user. Each metal is the only way a mortal can access Preservation and the power of creation, after which it is vaporized. However, this is only true for the base sixteen Allomantic metals and not God Metals or their alloys. \n",

      "Allomancy is a spiritually hereditary trait, that does not follow the same principles of dominant and recessive physical genetics. Scadrians with mixed skaa-noble heritage generally must have a noble in the previous five generations in order to be born an Allomancer. The ability lays dormant until an Allomancer undergoes Snapping, which will activate their Allomantic abilities. The abilities can be used instinctually, including while unconscious, once awakened if the user is to ingest the correct type of metal, though training is required to use these powers well. Snapping does not affect the chances of having an Allomancer child. Twins are more likely to have the same metal, especially if they are identical instead of fraternal.\n",

      "God Metals do not fit in the modern Allomantic Table, and Scadrians appear to only know of the metals that correspond to the Scadrian Shards; lerasium, atium, and harmonium, the last of which could only be burned theoretically, as it explodes upon contact with liquids. Unlike the standard Allomantic metals, which are regular metal elements and compounds, God Metals are a condensed, solid form of pure Investiture. Alloys of God Metals can lead to additional abilities.\n",

      "Hoid, Metallic Arts\n",
      "Hoid has also gained access to Allomancy, by burning a bead of lerasium stolen from the Well of Ascension. This grants him power equivalent to that of the ancient Allomancers. It is uncertain how practiced he is with these powers, but he does make use of emotional Allomancy on at least one occasion. He also has access to atium. It is unknown whether or not Hoid has access to Feruchemy. However, he does have access to some unkeyed metalminds, which would not be useful to him without Feruchemical abilities or unsealed metalminds. The particular attributes that are stored in these metalminds are unknown. Hoid does not make use of Hemalurgy, to gain access to the Metallic Arts or any other manifestation of Investiture, as he is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards. He does, however, own many Hemalurgic spikes.\n",

      "In addition to Pulling and Pushing classifications, there are external and internal metals. External powers influence things outside an Allomancer's body, while internal powers influence the Allomancer. This naturally divides the sixteen Allomantic metals into four groups of four metals each: physical, mental, temporal, and enhancement powers. Each quadrant has a metal and alloy pair of an external power, and another pair of internal powers. \n",
