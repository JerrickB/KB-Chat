One of his major goals is the defeat of Rayse, the original Vessel of the Shard Odium. While Hoid has generally avoided direct involvement in the major events of the cosmere, he is oftentimes present in the periphery, influencing in large ways and small the people who will go on to alter the course of history, as well as occasionally taking on an apprentice to train at his side. Hoid has been present for events such as the restoration of the city of Elantris on Sel, the Catacendre of Scadrial, and the True Desolation of Roshar. Along the way he has gained access to a prodigious number of powerful Invested Arts and arcana, including Surgebinding, AonDor, Awakening, and Allomancy, among others.',\n",
