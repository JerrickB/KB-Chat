He was one of the major figures in the Shattering of Adonalsium, but avoided taking up a Shard himself, instead choosing to wander the cosmere pursing his unknown goals, often in the guise of a fool or storyteller. He may be guided at times by a mysterious sense about where he should go, but not what he is to accomplish there. One of his major goals is the defeat of Rayse, the original Vessel of the Shard Odium. While Hoid has generally avoided direct involvement in the major events of the cosmere, he is oftentimes present in the periphery, influencing in large ways and small the people who will go on to alter the course of history, as well as occasionally taking on an apprentice to train at his side. Hoid has been present for events such as the restoration of the city of Elantris on Sel, the Catacendre of Scadrial, and the True Desolation of Roshar. Along the way he has gained access to a prodigious number of powerful Invested Arts and arcana, including Surgebinding, AonDor, Awakening, and Allomancy, among others.',\n",

To the best of our knowledge, his face is lined, hawk-like and arrow shaped. Hoid is tall and thin and also has a sharp nose and jaw with delicate eyebrows. He tends to cock his head to one side and has keen blue eyes. Hoid's hair is white, though he was not born with that color and he occasionally dyes it.

He wears a stiff black coat and carries a long thin sword at his waist. This blade is not magically Invested but has personal value to Hoid.

I blame my upbringing.\" Hoid apologizes to Kelsier after beating him in a fight, stating he doesn\\'t have the inclination to do real harm to him. This aversion causes him to be nauseated when thinking about physically harming someone, and is sometimes bad enough to incapacitate him. However, this only extends to physical trauma- Hoid has no issues with mentally hurting someone or through inaction. Hoid also has issues with harming himself physically, such as when he has to manipulate another man into punching him when he wants a tooth knocked out, rather than just doing it himself.

Aesthetic beauty is given definition through audience expectation and interpretation, it relies deeply upon audience participation, and therefore is not eternal and independent.

He also told her to look for a grouping of six stars, a carving under her bed, which would lead her to Weev's secret supply of midnight aether. After Tress recovered the midnight aether, Ulaam confronted Hoid, asking if he had given the aether to her. Ulaam and Tress continued to press Hoid for information and he was able to tell them to look for a person that is not a person and could talk when they should not, which they realized referred to Charlie in his guise of Huck the rat.\",\n",

While Hoid was unable to directly remove the curse on Charlie, he was able to tweak the parameters so that Charlie could break the curse himself once he returned to Diggen's Point with Tress.
