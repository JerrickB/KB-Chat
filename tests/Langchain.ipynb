Scadrians with mixed skaa-noble heritage generally must have a noble in the previous five generations in order to be born an Allomancer. The ability lays dormant until an Allomancer undergoes Snapping, which will activate their Allomantic abilities. The abilities can be used instinctually, including while unconscious, once awakened if the user is to ingest the correct type of metal, though training is required to use these powers well. Snapping does not affect the chances of having an Allomancer child. Twins are more likely to have the same metal, especially if they are identical instead of fraternal.'),\n",

This differs to how Feruchemy works, as Allomancy is not being powered by the body of the Allomancer, but instead by an external force. Like the other Metallic Arts, Allomancy as a magic system formed through the natural interactions between the two Shards that inhabit Scadrial, Preservation and Ruin, and the planet itself, instead of being created by a specific Shard. This magic system, however, is generally tailored and fuelled by Preservation, although specific cases will involve an Allomancer drawing upon Ruin's essence instead. Like other forms of Investiture, Allomancy does not necessarily reflect the intent of the Shard which it is associated with.\")]"

He is able to regenerate any damaged body parts at will, including his head. He can also heal from being stabbed hemalurgically. Hoid is able to repress his healing factor in some way, preventing instantaneous healing, an ability that he makes use of in some of his disguises. This healing factor makes it very difficult to kill Hoid, although he is still at least somewhat vulnerable. The name of the manifestation of Investiture responsible for Hoid's healing is unknown, but it is ancient, likely originating from some Pre-Shattering source. It is uncertain whether or not this healing factor is at all related to Hoid's apparent agelessness, which is known to originate from a remnant of a weapon built to kill Adonalsium. Hoid is unafraid of Shardblades for multiple reasons, probably including his healing factor.\")]"
