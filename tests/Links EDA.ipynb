Believing that Lirin had stolen the spheres from Wistiow, he coerced the townspeople to stop making donations for Lirin’s work, which was the primary source of the family’s income. While the townsfolk acquiesced, they still secretly provided provisions to Lirin and Hesina. One night while drunk, Lirin told his son not to make the same mistakes he did and get sucked back into this tiny, foolish town. Kal argued that Lirin had always told him to come back, but Lirin admitted he’d been an idiot when he said that, adding that the townspeople didn’t want him there. Kal asked him why they couldn’t just spend the spheres, but his father said the spheres were for his education. Besides, if they did spend them, they would be doing exactly what Roshone wanted them to do. Instead, they did the best with what they had with Kal continuing his studies, Hesina taking on random jobs, and Tien apprenticing with Ral, a carpenter in town. At the same time, Kal was secretly still trying to decide what path he would take in the next several months, that of a surgeon or a spearman. A series of thumps interrupted Kal’s thoughts, sending him scrambling out of his chair. His father pulled open the door revealing not a monster, but three masked men demanding the spheres. However, they weren’t the highwaymen as Kaladin initially thought, but rather Luten, Horl, and Balsas, normal townsmen presumably hired by Roshone. Ashamed and caught off guard, the men left without taking anything.',\n",

As they rode through the city, Kal asked his father why they tried to hide the meeting. Lirin admitted that he wasn’t sure if he even wanted to attend as a part of him just wanted to take the family and flee to Kharbranth or another Alethi town. Lirin confessed that he had tried to leave once, but there was a tie between a man’s heart and his home and he couldn’t bring himself to leave. Having cared for the townspeople for so long, he couldn’t leave them in the hands of Roshone. Once they arrived, the pair were led to a dining room where Roshone was already eating. A servant gestured to a side table set up in a room off the main dining hall, but Lirin sat down at Roshone’s table insisting that he was of second nahn and surely he could have a place at his table. Not wasting any time, Roshone discussed their present situation and asked them to return the spheres, ending their defiance. When Kal responded with an outburst, Lirin sent him away to the kitchens. There, Roshone’s son, Rillir walked in with Laral, and confusing Kaladin for a servant, ordered him to fetch their supper. Kal, protesting that he wasn’t a servant, lost an argument over his calling with Rillir, leaving him humiliated. As Lirin and Kal left the mansion, the latter admitted to his father that he had been considering joining the army. However, he had resolved to becoming a surgeon so that he would have the education to stand up to the lighteyes. During their conversation, Kal saw something unfamiliar in his father’s eyes, guilt. He then realized that Lirin had indeed stolen the spheres from Wistiow, changing everything, but also changing nothing.

Not wanting to give in to Brightlord Sadeas, the bridgeleader asked other members of Bridge Four to pitch in money and food to care for the men. However, all refused except for Rock. He offered to share his food with Hobber, who was the least injured of the three. Knowing it would only be a matter of time before the rotspren were attracted to the wounded, Kaladin came up with the idea of collecting knobweed stems during stone-gathering detail. With the stems, he could create the antiseptic the men desperately needed and even sell some to get more supplies and food. Gaining the trust of Rock and Teft, Kaladin enlisted their help to find and collect the knobweed during their new detail. Syl assisted as well, finding patches of knobweed and guiding Rock—who was mysteriously able to see her—to them. While working to extract the sap that night, Kaladin started building camaraderie with the two men, even managing to get Rock to open up and share some of his life story.',\n",

In the chasms, Kaladin continued to build rapport with the men, bringing Dunny into the fold, who sang for the men while others hovered behind. Through their work, Kaladin came across a spear in the chasms. Picking it up and holding it drew the ire of Moash, Sigzil, and Earless Jaks, who began taunting the bridgeleader. Ignoring their gibes, Kaladin closed his eyes and went into a trance. He performed an advanced practice kata with the spear, revealing his talent as a genius spearman to the men, leaving them speechless. This particular sequence would years later become known as the Chasm Kata. During the display, Teft, along with some of the other men, noticed an unknown spren—actually Syl—zipping around Kaladin. Through the rest of their chasm duty and on the walk back, more men started to open up. The night culminated in Kaladin using the money he had earned to purchase food and assigning Rock to cook a stew. Not a single person refused to partake in eating around the fire.

The practice was slow going, which left Gaz pleased at the prospect of Bridge Four losing more members. Prior to the next bridge run, Kaladin gained Lopen as a member from a new batch of recruits. They were immediately sent the next run. Realizing it was going to be a difficult approach, Kaladin ordered Bridge Four to perform the side carry as they engaged the Parshendi. The side carry was a success as it completely protected Kaladin’s men. However, other bridge crews tried to emulate the side carry. Not having trained in the maneuver, the other bridge crews failed. Lacking a sufficient number of bridges to cross the chasms and with the timing of the assault desynchronized, the battle was thrown into chaos and  Sadeas lost.

Kaladin was able to swim with help from Tomor's device and destroyed the node in the well. Unfortunately the Sibling's corruption had gone so far that his healing was nearly gone, which was especially noticeable since Raboniel had injured him again. Kaladin went to escape the well, knowing he would be surrounded by Fused, but he and Syl were separated and the Pursuer locked him in by adding weights to the top of the well.

The purity of the metal corresponds to its effectiveness and alloys require precise compound percentages for maximum power. Burning an impure alloy may cause sickness, while metals that are not Allomantically viable cannot be burned after being ingested.',\n",

Dragonsteel will tell Hoid's backstory and the story of the Shattering of Adonalsium; Mistborn will have four series, following Scadrial from the Final Empire to the development of faster-than-light travel and the interaction between the various planets; The Stormlight Archive will be split into two arcs of five books each and is the story of the clash between the people of Roshar and Odium. Generally, knowledge of the cosmere as a whole will not be necessary until Dragonsteel and the final Mistborn trilogy, which are the beginning and the conclusion respectively of the cosmere sequence\",\n",

Though cosmere novels are intensive, as they require more thorough planning and continuity maintenance, Brandon also has an internal wiki and people like Peter and Karen Ahlstrom who help him keep the cosmere on track. When Brandon feels like he needs a break from the more stringent requirements of the cosmere, he'll turn to work on a less intensive novel or novella, which are almost always non-cosmere. If there is a concept he really wants to write but doesn't fit in the limitations of the cosmere, he moves it into a non-cosmere book. For example, The Rithmatist started as a cosmere novel, and its magics take many elements from cosmere magics, but Brandon decided that he did not want a version of Earth in the cosmere, and so moved it to its own universe. \",\n",

He was one of the major figures in the Shattering of Adonalsium, but avoided taking up a Shard himself, instead choosing to wander the cosmere pursing his unknown goals, often in the guise of a fool or storyteller. He may be guided at times by a mysterious sense about where he should go, but not what he is to accomplish there. One of his major goals is the defeat of Rayse, the original Vessel of the Shard Odium. While Hoid has generally avoided direct involvement in the major events of the cosmere, he is oftentimes present in the periphery, influencing in large ways and small the people who will go on to alter the course of history, as well as occasionally taking on an apprentice to train at his side. Hoid has been present for events such as the restoration of the city of Elantris on Sel, the Catacendre of Scadrial, and the True Desolation of Roshar. Along the way he has gained access to a prodigious number of powerful Invested Arts and arcana, including Surgebinding, AonDor, Awakening, and Allomancy, among others.',\n",

In the present, he\\'s confined to the planet Braize, but his influence can be felt on the entire Rosharan system.

Many of his splinters, the Unmade compel people to give in to powerful sensations - Ashertmarn compels people to revel mindlessly, and Nergaoul inspires exultation in battle. On the other hand, the overwhelming amount of emotions inspired by Odium are hateful, among them the aforementioned Thrill and the Rhythms of Odium-derived singer forms.

The wording of the First Ideal, however, is exact and is used by all orders, including the Lightweavers. It appears that it is not necessary to speak the First Ideal as a complete uninterrupted phrase, as when Navani Kholin spoke them to bond the Sibling, she spread the three sentences throughout the length of a conversation, and though he was unable to complete the Ideal before being killed, Elhokar Kholin stuttered and repeated its words.  The First Ideal acts as a motto and guide for the Radiants as a whole, and is known as the Ideal of Radiance by the Skybreakers, who may have carried the name over from the ancient Radiants. The unique Ideals of each order are designed as a progression that develops a Radiant's character toward the central concepts of their order. The Stormfather and Cultivation have some discretion in deciding whether or not a Radiant has progressed enough that their oath can be accepted, though this discretion appears to be limited. It is unclear whether or not the Stormfather had this ability prior to Honor's Splintering, but it seems likely it was instead Honor's decision at this time.

This true ideal matches up with the Spiritual Realm, and the human perception of ideals matches up with the Cognitive Realm. While Plato’s philosophy only includes two forms, Brandon uses three. The idea that everything has a spren comes from Shinto beliefs. Spinoza’s influence is in God being in everything and everything being made of one substance. Brandon’s interpretation of this is the Shards’ Investiture permeating everything in the cosmere. Other, more minor influences include Jung in the concept of Connection, idealism,, and the ship of Theseus thought experiment. The large number of philosophical influences on Realmatic Theory and the cosmere is because Brandon finds philosophy interesting. He took many philosophy classes in college. ',\n",

He is arrogant and very driven which, combined with his power, makes him incredibly dangerous; he is willing to go extremely far to achieve his goals—for example, he would be willing to use Hemalurgy on a large scale to create powerful Allomancers if ultimately necessary to protect Scadrial from other forces in the cosmere—though is not quite as utilitarian as Taravangian. Perhaps as a result of his egotism and arrogance, several of his plans involve setting himself up as a powerful, mysterious, or even divine figure. He is a great agent of chaos and is very good at tearing things down and messing with what other people want. There is a darkness to him that other heroes, such as Kaladin, would fight but that Kelsier instead embraces and is so ruthless that, in a fight with other notable people from the cosmere, he would be the most likely to win; even Hoid considers him incredibly dangerous.

Despite Preservation not usually being able to speak into the minds of other, due to some combination of Spook being near death, having a broken soul, and believing Kelsier was a god, he was able to talk to Spook. He used this opportunity to tell Spook to send a message to Vin, warning her that any spiked person could potentially be under Ruin's control. Secretly, however, he knew that Ruin would send Marsh to intercept the message, and was hoping that reading the message would give Marsh the information he needed to remove Vin's earring, which was also a Hemalurgic spike that was keeping her from taking up Preservation's power. When Marsh caught Vin in Luthadel, he attacked Ruin with Preservation's power, weakening Ruin's control over Marsh just enough for Marsh to rip out Vin's earring. With the spike removed, Kelsier encouraged her to take up the power, relinquishing it so that she can do so. After she and Elend are killed, Kelsier spoke with them before they moved on to the Beyond.\",\n",

This ribbon cannot squeeze through small gaps. They only hold enough Voidlight to make four jumps. Thus in battle, they usually use the first three jumps for attacking and the fourth to escape and replenish Voidlight. Forming a fourth husk will leave them trapped, unable to become a ribbon of light. Two ways of killing a Husked One include killing them before they evacuate the body, or forcing them to form a fourth body and kill them. They also cannot take anything with them that is not part of their body.
