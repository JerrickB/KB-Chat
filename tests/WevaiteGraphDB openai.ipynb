He may be guided at times by a mysterious sense about where he should go, but not what he is to accomplish there. One of his major goals is the defeat of Rayse, the original Vessel of the Shard Odium. While Hoid has generally avoided direct involvement in the major events of the cosmere, he is oftentimes present in the periphery, influencing in large ways and small the people who will go on to alter the course of history, as well as occasionally taking on an apprentice to train at his side. Hoid has been present for events such as the restoration of the city of Elantris on Sel, the Catacendre of Scadrial, and the True Desolation of Roshar. Along the way he has gained access to a prodigious number of powerful Invested Arts and arcana, including Surgebinding, AonDor, Awakening, and Allomancy, among others.',\n",

The ability allows him to Connect to whatever land he is in, temporarily altering his Spiritual aspect to believe that he was raised in that place, allowing him to speak as a native. While Hoid has learned naturally how to speak some foreign languages, and is decent with languages, he desires to pass as a local oftentimes, which requires something beyond natural learning. Generally he makes use of his Connection ability to communicate in foreign languages. This ability is not without fault though, as when Hoid speaks naturally it will fill in local idioms and phrases on its own, but if Hoid is careless and focuses on a specific word or phrase the ability may fail and he will say the word verbatim in his own tongue or it may be said in an odd way. Hoid is an expert in using his Connection ability, but even he sometimes makes mistakes. This is the reason he occasionally slips up and may say words that confuse others, such as \"coin\" and \"bunny\" on Roshar. As Hoid has demonstrated the ability to fluently speak foreign languages before the knowledge of unsealed metalminds became widespread, it is unlikely that he is making use of Feruchemical duralumin to manipulate Connection.',\n",

However, there are various methods of detecting Investiture that could circumvent this suppression. Hoid's perfect pitch does aid him in tuning instruments and making music.
